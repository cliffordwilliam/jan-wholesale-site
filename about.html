              <h2>Our Background</h2>
              <hr />
              <p>
                Frosts Food & Beverage started its operations in 1996, at our
                present location in Tuas. Our 27,000 square feet facility has 3
                large freezer rooms with a total capacity of about 500 standard
                pallet space, chiller rooms and dry goods storage space.
                Starting off primarily with import and distribution activities,
                we have since started a sister company ( Quix Pte Ltd ) that
                does fresh Food Processing on site.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this new activity, we now service all the major convenience
                store chains and petrol stations, supplying them with an
                interesting basket of goods. We are able to service them by
                breaking bulk for fresh items and dealing with very specialized
                Freeze – Thaw logistics. As a result, we are an ideal
                distributor for product lines which have shorter shelf lives in
                a “fresh” condition and would require smaller but more frequent
                visits to the outlets.​

            <h2>Distribution</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
              We buy quality products from all over the world and distribute
              them in Singapore with our own cold chain logistics to major
              Hotels, Restaurants, Café Chains, Fast Food Chains and other
              institutional customers such as Airline Catering Houses. In the
              last couple of years, we have also added many retail lines in our
              portfolio and now serve practically all the major retailers in
              Singapore.

            <h2>Market & Positioning</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Unlike other food service wholesalers and distributors that have
              to cover larger geographical territories, we do not adopt a
              grocery list approach to selling and seek to provide more than
              just a pure logistic service. For example, to introduce new
              products and reinforce awareness of existing brands, we have held
              mini food shows targeted at a relevant guest list of potential
              customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our philosophy is to be an extension of our principals' marketing
              arm. We act as their eyes and ears in Singapore to look out and
              give them the extra mileage they are looking for. Our principals
              have often told us that they get many international leads
              resulting from their presence in Singapore.
